# GoLearn
repository to learn and build in GoLang

## in this Repository
1. Language notes: a folder for me to keep various notes about Go's syntax
	- gotour.md: notes from gotour. At about 3/4 of the way through I found myself coying and pasting these notes in, so I decided to just spend my time reading carefully. I have a local version of "a tour of go" so I can always use it as a reference
2. WIG (writing an interpreter in Go)
	- I'm working off of the latest version of the book (jan 2024)
	- today marks the day that I get down to business (1/3/2024)
